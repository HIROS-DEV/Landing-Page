# What did I learn through this course

I got the three concepts of flex box in this course mainly.

One:

I got the fundamental concepts of flex box and how to use it.
For example, I learned the short property flex and the long property flex (flex-grow / flex-shrink / flex-basis)

Two:

I got main axis and cross axis concepts in flex box and how to change it with using "flex-direction".

Three:

And finally, I got knowledge that how to align text in the web page and how to use it.
For example, I created the web page with using "justify-content" and "align-items" property.

## Summary

CSS FlexBox is indispensable skills in today's web world.
But, I think it can not understand easily. (Especially, flex-grow / flex-shrink / flex-basis concepts)

So, it is very useful for me to the course.

Thank you for reading.
And, happy coding!!!
